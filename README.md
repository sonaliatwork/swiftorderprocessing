LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY IS DEVELOPED DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINT AND MARKED AS TO BE DEVELOPED IN FUTURE.

P.S. The commit into GitHub was not happening for unknown reason, In one of the attempts I put commit comment as "First May be" and coincidentally it worked. I believe in professional work the text has to be brief and should represent the task completed. I could do only final commit, though I understand multiple commit with brief description was expected. 
THANK YOU.
